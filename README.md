### 1. Time Travel messages
Using the pywhatkit module, you can send messages to any one in advance. But for this to work you must be logged into your web.whatsapp.com. This code will open that website one minute before the specified time and send the message at the time mentioned. Run the whatsapp_msg_send.py to send your very own "time travel messages" to your friends. Replace the firt argument with the number you want to send to. The last two parameters are the hour and the minutes respectively at when the message should be sent. 

pywhatkit module can do more than just send whatsapp messages. For more information, check out https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/
